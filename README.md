The entry on [Legal Probabilism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-probabilism/) in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy which I co-authored with  [Marcello Di Bello](https://www.marcellodibello.com/) includes a   <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-probabilism/#BayeNetwForLegaAppl" target="_blank">section</a>  on Bayesian networks. Here, I provide more details and source code in R for  the examples discussed in that section.

- If you just want to get the code, here is [the folder](https://github.com/rfl-urbaniak/LegalProbabilismBNs/tree/gh-pages/code) with  R files containing bare code for the BNs and the wrapper functions. The **code folder** includes:

  - cptCreate.R with wrappers for easier generation of conditional probability tables.
  - legalidioms.R with the actual code used to build the BNs and run the calculations.

- If you prefer to look at the code with some explanation of what's going on and why, [go here](https://rfl-urbaniak.github.io/LegalProbabilismBNs/).
