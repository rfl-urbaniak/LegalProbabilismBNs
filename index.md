## Bayesian Networks: a crash-course

A random variable (RV) $X$ is a function from the elements of a sample space into $\mathbb{R}$, the set of real numbers. For instance, if our sample space is the set of all potential outcomes of tossing a fair coin four times (each such outcome can be represented as a sequence, for instance  $HHHT$, or $HTHT$), $X$ can be the number of heads among the tosses.
